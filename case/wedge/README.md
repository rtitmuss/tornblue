### Case

You can 3d print a wedge case for your Tornblue using the follow files:

No supports are required for the base.

The edge prints upside down so the visible surface is on the print bed. You need to print with supports.

## Post processing

You need to do some post processing on the case wall. Remove the support from the top of the case and clean up the bridging by the USB connector and switch holes. Give the case a good rub to remove any stray fibers.
